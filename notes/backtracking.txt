Sure, let's break down the code for solving the "Combination Sum II" problem, which finds all unique combinations of numbers that sum up to a target value. The approach used here involves recursion and backtracking.

Code Explanation
Reading Input:

The code reads a line of space-separated integers and a target integer from the input.
It converts the input string into an integer array arr and sorts it. Sorting helps to handle duplicates and improve the efficiency of the solution.
Finding Combinations:

The findCombinations method is the core of the solution. It uses backtracking to explore all possible combinations of numbers that add up to the target value.
Detailed Walkthrough
Let's go through how findCombinations works with an example input. Suppose we have the input 10 1 2 7 6 5 1 5 and a target of 8.

Initial Call:

java
Copy code
findCombinations(arr, target, 0, new ArrayList<>(), result);
arr is the sorted array: [1, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 10]
target is 8
start is 0
current is an empty list: []
result is an empty list of lists: []
First Iteration (i=0):

Add 1 to current: [1]
New target: 8 - 1 = 7
Recurse: findCombinations(arr, 7, 1, [1], result)
Second Iteration (i=1):

Add 1 to current: [1, 1]
New target: 7 - 1 = 6
Recurse: findCombinations(arr, 6, 2, [1, 1], result)
Third Iteration (i=2):

Add 2 to current: [1, 1, 2]
New target: 6 - 2 = 4
Recurse: findCombinations(arr, 4, 3, [1, 1, 2], result)
Fourth Iteration (i=3):

Add 5 to current: [1, 1, 2, 5]
New target: 4 - 5 = -1 (No valid combination, backtrack)
Backtrack: Remove 5, current is [1, 1, 2]

Continue Iterating:

Remove 2 from current: [1, 1]
Try next number (i=3): Add 5, current becomes [1, 1, 5], New target: 6 - 5 = 1
Recurse: findCombinations(arr, 1, 4, [1, 1, 5], result)
Further Iterations:

Continue in a similar manner, trying each number and backtracking when necessary.
Key Points
Backtracking: The code explores each possibility, adds a number to the current combination, and recurses. If a solution is not found or the current combination exceeds the target, it backtracks by removing the last added number.
Skipping Duplicates: To avoid duplicate combinations, the code skips over consecutive identical numbers (arr[i] == arr[i - 1]).
Example Output
For input 10 1 2 7 6 5 1 5 with target 8, the output will be:

csharp
Copy code
[1, 1, 6]
[1, 2, 5]
[1, 7]
[2, 6]
This means these are the unique combinations of numbers that add up to 8.

Conclusion
The recursive method findCombinations explores all possible combinations of numbers using backtracking. By sorting the array and skipping duplicates, it ensures that the solutions are unique and efficiently found.

Absolutely! Let's walk through the code with a detailed example to see how the algorithm works step-by-step. We'll use the input 10 1 2 7 6 5 1 5 with a target of 8.

Input Breakdown
Input Array: 10 1 2 7 6 5 1 5
Target: 8
Steps and Execution
Parse and Sort Input:

Convert input to integer array: [10, 1, 2, 7, 6, 5, 1, 5]
Sort Array: [1, 1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 7, 10]
The sorted array helps in skipping duplicates and making the process efficient.
