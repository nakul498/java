Spring ORM - spring with ORM Frameworkds
ORM- Object Relational Mapping
   ORM framework tools - Hibernate, toplink, iBatis

Spring with Hibernate 
we will get hiberante template in spring 
- less code is required
- Easy to test
- Better exception handling (spring have better exception handling)
- Integrated Trasaction management

Working with database
earlier 
    java program -----> JDBC -------> Database
                JDBC Approach

so we use ORM for this process -> use JDBC internally

we make a class 
according to table      <-----ORM------>      database Table

we will send object to ORM and then ORM will return object in case we need some data.

HibernateTemplate - it provides all the functionality that we need to do with out database.
    - Save
    - Update
    - Insert
    - Get
    - LoadALL

How to work with Spring ORM

    eg product Dao      
    Dao Class           --------> Hibernate Template ------------> SessionFactory       -----------> 
Dao - data access object                                         it is an interface
    Interface                                                   (can not create object of it)   
        |                                                               ^
        |                                                               |
        |                                                               |
    productDaoImpl                                                      |                                    
                                    dataSource ------->            localSessionFactoryBean
                                    database properties        (it is implementaion classof session Factory)        
                                    url, username, password         1. dataSource
                                                                    2. Hiberante Properties - sql property etc
                                                                    3. AnnotatedClass      - which all classes is entity
JPA -  specification by oracle, implementation is same as hibernate but there is difference in some clas.
