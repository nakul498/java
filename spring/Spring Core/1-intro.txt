What is Spring?
Spring is a dependency injection framework to make java aplication loosely coupled (easy to modefy)

Spring framework makes the easy developmemnt of JaveEE application.

it was developed by rod Joghnson in 2003

Dependency injection

it is a design pattern. 
eg a class in dependent on other class so to create object of that class so in spring this part will be done by IOC as will be injected.
we will use xml file or annotation in base class to show where we wana use dependency injection.
inversion of control(IOC)


UI Layer -> Bussiness/Services Layer -> Data Access Layer -> DB
Product Controller -> Product Service  -> ProductDao -> DB

dependency injection will create object of productDao in Product Service and object of product service in product Controller. 

Spring JDBC - spring provide this api to intract with DB in data Access Layer
